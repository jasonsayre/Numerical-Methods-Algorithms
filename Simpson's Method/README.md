# Simpson's Method
## This function integrates experimental data by using the Simpson's 1/3 rule. If there are an odd number of intervals, however, then the trapezoidal rule is used on the last interval. It does so by taking the (x) and (y) inputs and integrating this data 
### Syntax: 
   * Please execute this function as follows: '[I] = Simpson(x,y)'
### Inputs:
  * x - data
  * y - data
### Outputs:
  * I - Integration numerical data
### Limitations: 
  * Must input only 2 input arguments
### Additional Information: 
  * This function will display in matlab whether or not the trapezoid rule was executed for the last segment
