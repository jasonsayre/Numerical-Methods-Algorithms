# Lu Factorization Method
## luFactor is a created function that solves for variables (finds root) so that all expressions are true. It does so based on a user's matrix input. It uses the lu factorization technique which makes solving similar equations quicker and more efficient.
### Syntax: 
  * Please execute the function as follows: '[L U P] = luFactor(A)'
### Inputs:
  * A - coefficient matrix
### Outputs:
  * L - lower triangular matrix
  * U - upper triangular matrix
  * P - the pivot matrix
